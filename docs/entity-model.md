# RunWield Entity Model

This document is the entity-model companion to [`architecture.md`](architecture.md). The architecture document maps
control flow, dependency direction, runtime boundaries, and source guides; this document maps durable entities,
transient workflow objects, adapter projections, and storage authorities.

## How to read this

These diagrams are conceptual entity relationships, not database schemas. Cardinality describes the domain relationship
that engineers should preserve, not a required table shape or serialization format. Entity names follow
[`docs/domain-language.md`](domain-language.md); diagram identifiers use underscores only so Mermaid renders
predictably.

## Project and artifact model

```mermaid
erDiagram
    WORKSPACE ||--o{ PROJECT : registers
    PROJECT ||--o{ SESSION : scopes
    PROJECT ||--o{ PLAN : stores
    PROJECT ||--o{ PRD : contains
    PROJECT ||--o{ ADR : contains
    PROJECT ||--o{ WORK_RECORD : stores
    PROJECT ||--o{ MEMORY : scopes
    PROJECT ||--o{ TICKET_REFERENCE : relates
    EPIC ||--o{ CHILD_PLANNED_CHANGE_PLAN : parentPlan
    PLAN ||--o{ WORK_RECORD : summarized_by
    PLAN }o--o{ TICKET_REFERENCE : links
    WORK_RECORD }o--o{ TICKET_REFERENCE : links
    MEMORY ||--o| LOCAL_MEMORY : may_be
    MEMORY ||--o| TEAM_MEMORY : may_be
    PRD }o--o{ PLAN : informs
    ADR }o--o{ PLAN : constrains
```

- **Identity:** `Project`, `Session`, `Plan`, `Work Record`, and `Ticket Reference` are durable user- or project-facing
  entities. A `Plan` also carries a durable `planId`; an Epic is a `PROJECT` Plan, and a child `PLANNED_CHANGE` Plan
  points to its Epic through `parentPlan`.
- **Ownership:** The repository owns Plans, PRDs, ADRs, Work Records, and source code. Workspace registers Projects and
  projects artifacts into browser surfaces, but Workspace labels and cards are not authoritative project knowledge.
- **Lifecycle:** Plans participate in Plan Lifecycle. PRDs, ADRs, Work Records, Memories, and Ticket References inform
  planning and navigation but do not participate in Plan Lifecycle. Every project `Memory` is either a `Local Memory` or
  a `Team Memory`; the diagram uses two optional subtype edges because Mermaid ER diagrams cannot express that either/or
  constraint directly.
- **Work Record cardinality:** A `Plan` accumulates zero or more `Work Records` over its lifetime, which is why this
  diagram shows `summarized_by` as one-to-many. At most one of them is the current retrievable record; the rest are
  superseded or archived. The execution diagram below shows that single current record as `produces_current`. The two
  edges describe the same relation at different points in time, not a contradiction.
- **Source-of-truth caveats:** A `Team Memory` is a project `Memory` whose canonical human-readable text is versioned in
  the repository and whose local Mnemoteca copies are derived from that trusted text; it is not a container that
  includes other Memories. A `Ticket Reference` is a structured URL relation only. RunWield does not copy, own, or
  synchronize external Ticket content, status, or lifecycle.

## Session and Agent model

```mermaid
erDiagram
    PROJECT ||--o{ SESSION : scopes
    SESSION ||--|| SESSION_TRANSCRIPT : persists
    SESSION_TRANSCRIPT ||--|{ SESSION_TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT : orders
    SESSION ||--o{ AGENT_SESSION : contains
    SESSION ||--o{ SESSION_CONTROL : grants
    AGENT_SESSION }o--|| AGENT : invokes
    AGENT ||--|| AGENT_DEFINITION : configured_by
    AGENT_SESSION }o--o{ SKILL : loads
    AGENT_SESSION }o--|| TOOLSET : binds
    TOOLSET ||--o{ CUSTOM_TOOL : exposes
    AGENT_SESSION ||--o{ DELEGATED_AGENT_SESSION : delegates
```

- **Identity:** A `Session` is the stable user-facing thread in one Project. The in-process Runtime session ID, Pi
  Session Manager ID, and ACP protocol ID are scoped handles around that durable thread and must not be treated as the
  same identity.
- **Ownership:** Session transcript storage owns private raw message and event history. `HostedSession` owns live
  mutable state while the process is running; adapters only hold opaque Runtime IDs and render Runtime events.
- **Lifecycle:** An `Agent Session` is one invocation context inside a Session. Delegated Agent Sessions are disposable,
  context-isolated children whose result returns to the parent Agent Session.
- **Source-of-truth caveats:** Session Transcripts are private Session history. They are not Work Records, shared
  project knowledge, or default cross-Session Agent retrieval material.

## Plan workflow model

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER_REQUEST ||--o| TRIAGE_REPORT : classified_by
    TRIAGE_REPORT }o--|| ROUTING_INTENT : selects
    ROUTING_INTENT ||--o{ PLAN : may_materialize
    PLAN }o--|| PLAN_STATUS : has
    PLAN ||--o{ PLAN_EVENT : records
    PLAN ||--o| PLAN_WORKFLOW_LEASE : claimed_by
    PLAN ||--o{ REVIEW_LOOP : reviewed_by
    REVIEW_LOOP ||--o{ FEEDBACK : returns
    FEEDBACK ||--o{ REVISION : drives
    REVISION ||--o{ REVIEW_LOOP : resubmits
    PLAN ||--o{ READINESS_GATE : passes_through
    PLAN_EVENT ||--o{ WORKFLOW_DECISION : informs
```

- **Identity:** `User Request`, `Triage Report`, `Feedback`, `Revision`, `Workflow Decision`, and `Readiness Gate` are
  workflow/context-scoped records or decisions, not long-lived project knowledge by themselves. The durable entity is
  the Plan file and its front matter.
- **Ownership:** Router owns the Triage Report. Planner or Architect owns Plan drafting. Plan Lifecycle owns Plan Status
  transitions from recorded Plan Events. Plannotator supplies review decisions and Feedback.
- **Lifecycle:** `PLANNED_CHANGE` and `PROJECT` are the Plan-producing classifications. Legacy `FEATURE` classification
  input normalizes to `PLANNED_CHANGE`; `FEATURE` remains a Work Kind value when describing the nature of work.
- **Source-of-truth caveats:** `Workflow Decision` tells callers what to do next without directly changing Plan Status.
  Durable status changes come from Plan Events applied through Plan Lifecycle.

## Execution, validation, and delivery model

```mermaid
erDiagram
    PLAN ||--o| EXECUTION_WORKTREE : runs_in
    EXECUTION_WORKTREE }o--|| WORKTREE_REGISTRY : registered_in
    EXECUTION_WORKTREE ||--o| PUBLICATION_CANDIDATE : seals
    USER_REQUEST ||--o{ MECHANICAL_VALIDATION : quick_fix_check
    PLAN ||--o{ WORKFLOW_VALIDATION : validates
    WORKFLOW_VALIDATION ||--o{ REVIEW_ISSUE_LEDGER : records_attempt
    REVIEW_ISSUE_LEDGER ||--o{ REVIEW_ISSUE : blocks
    REVIEW_ISSUE_LEDGER ||--o{ REVIEW_ADVISORY : notes
    WORKFLOW_VALIDATION ||--o| DIRECT_DELIVERY : publishes
    WORKFLOW_VALIDATION ||--o| CHANGE_REQUEST_DELIVERY : publishes
    CHANGE_REQUEST_DELIVERY ||--o| FORGE_CHANGE_REQUEST : opens
    PLAN ||--o| WORK_RECORD : produces_current
```

- **Identity:** An Execution Worktree has local filesystem, branch, baseline, and registry identity, but the Plan
  remains the durable workflow identity. A Publication Candidate is the exact locally validated revision intended for
  delivery.
- **Ownership:** The Plan file owns recovery pointers in front matter. The worktree registry owns local operational
  records under a lock. Git owns branches, commits, merges, and target-ref proof.
- **Lifecycle:** Mechanical Validation is the no-Plan `QUICK_FIX` path. Workflow Validation is the Plan path and can use
  semantic review, repair loops, optional human code review, and delivery.
- **Source-of-truth caveats:** `Review Issue Ledger`, Review Issues, Review Advisories, validation command output, and
  runtime events are attempt-scoped evidence. A Forge Change Request is provider-owned delivery/navigation state;
  RunWield records delivery evidence but does not own the Forge lifecycle.

## Persistence and authority

| Toolset and Custom Tool    | Effective tool names and call IDs             | Agent definition/tool registry plus runtime custom tool binding  | Tool registry and Agent Session binding          | Tool call events are runtime evidence, not durable project knowledge by default.      |
