# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve RunWield. RunWield is source-available and accepts issues and pull requests, but it is not
open source yet. Before contributing, read the [license](../LICENSE).

## Start with the design docs

RunWield has strong workflow opinions. Before changing behavior, read the docs that explain the current model:

- [Core Architecture](architecture.md) maps the runtime boundary, workflow orchestration, Plan lifecycle, validation,
  persistence, and source guide.
- [Entity Model](entity-model.md) maps durable entities, transient workflow objects, adapter projections, and storage
  authorities.
- [Plan Lifecycle](plan-lifecycle.md) explains Plan statuses, events, validation, repair, and delivery.
- [Settings Reference](settings.md) documents configuration files, precedence, and commands.
- [Themes](themes.md) and the [Design System](design-system.md) cover user-facing UI conventions.

Product and architecture guidance:

- [ADRs](adr/) hold Architecture Decision Records. Read the relevant ADRs for any architectural seam you touch.
- Five living central PRDs hold current principles and lasting requirements: [RunWield](prd/runwield.md),
  [Core](prd/runwield-core-prd.md), [Connect](prd/runwield-connect-prd.md), [Workspace](prd/runwield-workspace-prd.md),
  and [ACP](prd/runwield-acp-protocol-prd.md). Other PRDs are transient proposals. After implementation, fold lasting
  requirements into the central owner, update references, and remove the completed PRD. Git history preserves proposals;
  Work Records preserve delivery evidence.

## Development setup

Contributors use Deno. Common commands:

```bash
deno task cli "your request"
deno task check
deno task test
deno task ci
deno task docs:dev
deno task docs:check
deno task compile
```

`deno task ci` runs all ten static gates, then the source tests and Golden TUI portfolio in one isolated worker queue.
`deno task pr:check` is an alias for that complete local gate. Successful CI prints one summary; failure diagnostics are
filtered through Snip and retained in the reported log. Use `deno task ci --source-only` when a separate required Golden
job owns those scenarios, as the PR and release workflows do.

`deno task test` remains the focused source suite. `deno task test:golden-tui` runs the composed TUI scenarios and their
harness tests; `test:golden-tui:extensive` runs the same complete portfolio. Always use these tasks or
`deno run -A scripts/run-tests.js <deno test args>`; never invoke `deno test` directly. Each file gets a separate
process, HOME, temporary directory, and Mnemoteca database.

Interactive RunWield sessions expect these helper binaries in `PATH`:

- [`mnemoteca`](https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemoteca) for memory-backed agent behavior.
- [`cymbal`](https://github.com/1broseidon/cymbal) for code intelligence.
- [`agent-browser`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser) for browser-driven UI/UX verification.
- [`snip`](https://github.com/edouard-claude/snip) for compact command-output rewriting. Snip is optional at runtime and
  fail-open, but local validation tasks may invoke it when installed by the standard setup path.

The shell installer is the normal standalone recovery path for missing helper binaries. Package-managed installs should
be repaired with their package manager instead. The prepared Homebrew formula uses `gandazgul/tap/mnemoteca`,
`1broseidon/tap/cymbal`, `ketch`, `agent-browser`, and `git`; it does not run helper setup during formula installation.
RunWield also ships bundled Snip filters for Deno validation output; install or remove user-level copies with:

```bash
wld snip-filters install
wld snip-filters cleanup
```

## Codebase guide

Use this as an orientation map, not a directory inventory:

- `src/cli.ts` is the executable entry point and command dispatch module. It delegates command behavior to handlers
  registered from `src/cmd/`.
- `src/cmd/` owns CLI command boundaries such as `router`, `load-plan`, `plans`, `workspace`, `init`, settings, auth,
  and install/update helpers.
- `src/shared/session/` is the live Session runtime center of gravity: hosted sessions, agent construction, transcript
  segments, adapter-neutral events, and continuation control.
- `src/shared/workflow/` owns routing decisions, Plan approval/execution orchestration, lifecycle transitions,
  mechanical and semantic validation, repairs, and Epic/FEATURE flow.
- `src/shared/` also contains cross-cutting project state, settings, model/resource handling, collaboration, worktrees,
  work records, and runtime preflight helpers.
- `src/agent-definitions/`, `src/prompt-templates/`, and `src/skills/` are the bundled agent, slash-prompt, and skill
  layers. Project `.wld/` overrides home `~/.wld/`, which overrides these bundled defaults.
- `src/extensions/` contains runtime integrations for Mnemoteca, Cymbal, and Snip. Keep integration-specific tools,
  hooks, and tests isolated there when practical.
- `src/tools/` contains RunWield-specific agent tools that are not better owned by an extension package.
- `src/ui/tui/` is the terminal adapter. `src/ui/workspace/`, `src/review-workspace-server.js`, and `src/ui/review/` are
  the browser Workspace and review surfaces. Shared visual language belongs in `src/ui/design-system/` and
  `src/ui/theme/`.
- `docs/plans/` stores durable Plan Markdown. `docs/` (outside `docs/plans/`) stores user, contributor, architecture,
  ADR, PRD, and product docs.

## Golden TUI Scenarios

Golden TUI Scenarios are deterministic, Playwright-like regression tests for the composed terminal UI and workflow
runtime. Run them with:

```bash
deno task test:golden-tui
# release-tier alias
deno task test:golden-tui:extensive
```

Golden tests exercise the real TUI composition, Session Runtime, workflow transitions, storage, and Git repositories.
Keep these journey tests: passing isolated source tests cannot prove that those pieces work together. Their terminal
adapter and scripted external model responses make failures reproducible without replacing internal machinery.

Golden setup copies immutable real Git baselines into separate repositories and remotes. Each scenario still gets its
own mutable filesystem, settings, stores, and locks. Fixture providers preserve streaming deltas without artificial
network delays; scenarios that test interruption can explicitly request slow streaming with `modelTokensPerSecond`.

Local runs use up to eight workers, bounded by available CPUs; override with `WLD_TEST_CONCURRENCY`. PRs and releases
run four source shards with four workers each and four Golden shards with three workers each. Every shard is required.
The standalone Golden workflow also covers pushes to `main` and `release/**`. Shard membership depends only on the
sorted file list, never a runner's timing cache. Reproduce one shard with `--shard 2/4` in isolated discovery mode or
`WLD_TEST_SHARD=2/4`. Nested runner tests clear the inherited shard selection.

Timing does not require verbose output. Reports under `.ci-cache/` contain:

- `ci-timings.json`: elapsed time for every CI task.
- `tests[-N-of-M]-timings.json` and `golden[-N-of-M]-timings.json`: file timing history used for scheduling.
- `*-report/run.json`: file durations, prewarm time, worker count, and pass/fail/skip totals for the latest run.
- `*-report/*.xml`: Deno's JUnit results with each test's name, duration, failure, and ignored status.

Use `--report-dir <directory>` for separate benchmark runs and `--timings-file <file>` for an explicit history. CI
uploads these reports even on failure. Timing history starts slow files first from the first observation. Dependency
caches can be reused with `WLD_TEST_DENO_DIR`; mutable RunWield state remains isolated per file. `deno task ci` collects
all failures by default so an Agent can repair them together. Use `deno task ci --fail-fast` for quicker first-failure
feedback: it stops scheduling new files after a failure and lets active files finish. Passing runs still execute every
selected test; failures and unexecuted files never produce a green gate.

Author scenarios under `src/ui/tui/golden-scenarios/` and shared harness helpers under `src/ui/tui/testing/`:

- use hand-written scenario scripts and assertions; do not use raw Session Transcript JSONL as the scenario format;
- drive user behavior through terminal actions or the public Golden runner, not by reaching into private TUI blocks;
- keep expected answers, scripts, images, and fixtures outside the temporary Project root when an Agent's tools could
  discover them;
- declare coverage capabilities on scenarios and back each declaration with an assertion wrapped by
  `assertCoverageWith`;
- prefer semantic assertions: normalized screen text, Runtime events, Plan metadata, workflow outcomes, worktree/Git
  facts, Session replacement identity, validation evidence, Work Records, and cleanup state;
- normalize unstable UUIDs, paths, ports, durations, commit hashes, and animation frames only at comparison/reporting
  edges.

When diagnosing a failure, inspect the retained artifact path in the thrown error. Golden diagnostics should identify
the scenario, active Agent/phase, recent Runtime activity, last normalized screen, remaining scripted turns, and durable
temp state. Update expected output only when the user-visible workflow behavior intentionally changed; do not weaken a
scenario to bypass a real Runtime, workflow, Plan Review, validation, worktree, or TUI defect.

Golden TUI Scenarios are not browser Plan Review tests, live-model benchmarks, ACP parity tests, or true-PTY smoke
tests. Browser behavior remains owned by Workspace/Playwright coverage; future PTY smoke tests should stay as a thin
startup/raw-terminal layer rather than replacing these deterministic scenarios.

## Bundled runtime extensions

Runtime integrations live under `src/extensions/`. They are loaded as Pi extension factories during Agent Session setup.

- `src/extensions/mnemoteca/` adds memory recall, storage, and deletion tools backed by Mnemoteca.
- `src/extensions/cymbal/` adds code search, symbol lookup, impact analysis, and tracing tools backed by Cymbal.
- `src/extensions/snip/` adds a fail-open `tool_call` hook that prefixes eligible agent `bash` commands with Snip.

Keep extension behavior isolated to the extension package where practical. Session wiring should decide whether an
extension is available and register it; the extension should own its event handlers, tool definitions, command
rewriting, and focused tests.

## Code style

- New production source files should be TypeScript (`.ts` or `.tsx` as appropriate). Existing JavaScript with JSDoc is
  still valid; do not force-convert unrelated files, but migrate JS files when you are already touching them for source
  changes and the migration is reasonably bounded.
- Keep Deno-native execution. Use real file extensions in imports, do not add a `tsc` emit pipeline for runtime code,
  and let `deno check`/CI be the type gate.
- Do not use `any`, `unknown`, or bare `object` in TypeScript types. Define named object shapes instead of inline
  complex types.
- In remaining JavaScript, use JSDoc for types. Prefer `@typedef` for object shapes and type function parameters in the
  `@param` block rather than adding casts or body-local `@type` declarations.
- Keep CLI entry points thin. Command behavior belongs under `src/cmd/<command>/`; shared behavior belongs under
  `src/shared/` or the narrower center of gravity that owns it.
- Resolve home and cwd through `getHomeDir()` and `getCwd()` from `src/constants.js` in `src/`. Do not read
  `Deno.env.get("HOME")` or `Deno.cwd()` directly in source, and do not cache process-global state at module scope.
- Wrap tests that mutate `HOME` or the working directory in `withProcessGlobalTestLock` from
  `src/testing/process-global-lock.js`.
- Preserve the layered customization model: project `.wld/` overrides home `~/.wld/`, which overrides bundled defaults.
- Keep docs, plans, ADRs, PRDs, and Work Records as Markdown.

## Public documentation

The public manual uses the selected Markdown guides in `docs/`; `docs/index.md` is its home. `deno task docs:dev` starts
the Starlight preview at `http://localhost:4322`. `deno task docs:check` validates and builds the published pages. PRDs,
Plans, Work Records, audits, and research remain in the repository but are not public manual pages.

`docs/stable` is the source for `docs.runwield.dev`. It identifies the Stable release it describes. Make corrections to
that branch through normal review, then forward-port the same correction to `main`. Do not add unreleased product
behavior to `docs/stable`. A Stable release merges its tagged source into the branch without force-pushing, so retained
corrections survive. Resolve a merge conflict by checking the instruction against the released product; a failed merge
leaves the existing site live.

## Pull request checklist

1. Create a branch.
2. Make focused changes.
3. Update docs when behavior changes.
4. Run `deno task ci` for code changes.
5. For docs-only or config-only changes, run `deno fmt` at minimum.
6. Open a PR with:
   - a summary,
   - the affected routing intent or flow (`INQUIRY`, `IDEATION`, `OPERATION`, `QUICK_FIX`, `PLANNED_CHANGE`, or
     `PROJECT`),
   - validation notes,
   - any follow-up work or known gaps.

## Workflow expectations

RunWield itself is plan-by-default for non-trivial work. Contributions should preserve that product shape:

- `INQUIRY` handling should stay answer-focused through Guide.
- `IDEATION` handling should clarify ideas through Ideator before routing implementation work.
- `OPERATION` work should stay non-code and self-verified by Operator.
- `QUICK_FIX` work should stay small, code-bounded, and pass Mechanical Validation after Engineer completion.
- `PLANNED_CHANGE` work should be traceable to a reviewable plan when the blast radius is non-trivial.
- `PROJECT` work should be represented as an Epic: Architect owns the design, interactive Slicer owns child
  PLANNED_CHANGE boundaries, and execution happens through those child PLANNED_CHANGE plans.
- Workflow validation should remain an independent acceptance gate for saved plan execution.
