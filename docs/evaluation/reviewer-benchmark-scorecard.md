# Reviewer Benchmark Scorecard

## Purpose

Measure whether RunWield's Semantic Reviewer finds real defects without manufacturing objections, and whether its
verification rounds track repairs accurately. The benchmark compares the current discovery prompt with candidate Review
Reconnaissance behavior through the normal isolated Reviewer Session, tools, and structured completion path.

This is an Agent-specific evaluator for the shared End-to-End Benchmark Harness. It does not define another runner,
replace Workflow Validation, or add passive product telemetry.

## Evaluated Configurations

The first experiment compares two configurations:

1. **Baseline** — the current Semantic Reviewer discovery and verification prompts.
2. **Candidate** — the same Reviewer with a first-discovery reconnaissance pass that:
   - explains the changed behavior and its input, environment, state, and surrounding-code assumptions;
   - searches adversarially for failure modes;
   - carries only confirmed defects and still-plausible risks into the verdict;
   - suppresses every risk it rules out.

Keep the model, provider, tools, Plan, repository revision, Runtime settings, and sampling settings equal. Randomize
configuration order within each fixture repetition so provider drift or warm-cache order does not consistently favor one
prompt.

## Benchmark Unit

One scored unit is one Reviewer round over:

- an Approved Plan;
- a baseline tree and candidate implementation tree;
- the production `review_diff` surface;
- normal read-only repository tools;
- a hidden oracle that the evaluated Reviewer cannot access.

Discovery fixtures run from an empty Review Issue Ledger. Repair fixtures begin with a supplied ledger, repair report,
and repair-scoped diff. They exercise the production verification prompt instead of asking a generic model to describe
whether a patch looks fixed.

## Output Policy

- A blocking finding must describe a concrete defect and cite repository evidence.
- A plausible risk may become a non-blocking test suggestion or advisory when evidence is incomplete.
- A ruled-out risk is omitted completely. It is not stored, displayed, scored, or counted as diligence.
- Approval prose and stylistic similarity to a reference answer are not quality measures.
- One defect reported several ways earns one match; the extra findings are duplicate noise.

## Primary Measures

### Defect recall

The fraction of distinct oracle defects matched by at least one supported finding:

`matched oracle defects / all oracle defects`

Report recall by defect family and severity. Critical and high-severity misses remain visible even when aggregate recall
is good.

### Blocking-finding precision

The fraction of blocking findings that match a real oracle defect or are adjudicated as a novel valid defect:

`supported unique findings / all blocking findings`

Unsupported findings and duplicate restatements reduce precision. A Reviewer cannot improve by producing a large list
around one correct observation.

### Clean approval rate

The fraction of clean twins approved without a blocking finding:

`approved clean variants / all clean variants`

This is the primary check against an adversarial prompt that rejects any code containing a suspicious-looking branch,
fallback, retry, cache, or concurrent operation.

### Severe-defect recall

Report critical and high-severity defect recall as its own release measure. Do not let several easy low-severity matches
offset a missed destructive, authorization, data-isolation, or lifecycle-authority defect.

### Repair-state accuracy

For every prior ledger item, score whether the Reviewer correctly classifies it as resolved or still open. Score new
regressions introduced by a repair as discovery recall and precision in the same round.

## Secondary Measures

- **Evidence accuracy** — the finding cites the changed file or behavioral boundary that contains the cause.
- **Causal accuracy** — the finding explains the trigger and wrong result, not only a downstream symptom.
- **Multi-defect completeness** — all independent defects are found before the Reviewer completes the round.
- **Advisory precision** — advisories are supported, relevant, and non-duplicative.
- **Protocol reliability** — the Reviewer inspects the diff and calls `review_complete` with valid, complete arguments.
- **Inspection breadth** — files and hunks inspected, retained only as a diagnostic rather than a quality target.
- **Cost** — input/output tokens, elapsed time, model turns, tool calls, and corrective nudges.
- **Stability** — per-fixture agreement across repetitions, including defects found in every trial rather than only
  once.

Inspection breadth is not rewarded by itself. Reading more files is valuable only when it improves supported findings.

## Finding Adjudication

Each emitted blocking finding receives one state:

- `matched` — describes an oracle defect's trigger and wrong behavior;
- `duplicate` — repeats a defect already matched in the same round;
- `unsupported` — no concrete defect can be established from the fixture;
- `novel_valid` — establishes a real defect that the oracle omitted.

Mechanical matching may use expected paths, spans, structured lifecycle decisions, and verifier outcomes. Semantic
equivalence requires a blinded human decision or a separately reported model-judge annotation. A model judge never
overrides deterministic proof.

When a finding appears novel and valid, freeze scoring for that fixture. A human updates the oracle first, then both
baseline and candidate outputs are rescored against the same corrected truth. Do not amend the oracle only for the
configuration that found the defect.

## Repetitions and Comparison

- Run at least three independent trials per fixture and configuration in the pilot.
- Keep every timeout, interruption, invalid tool result, and infrastructure failure in the report denominator.
- Compare paired per-fixture deltas before aggregate averages.
- Report confidence intervals or paired bootstrap intervals once the corpus is large enough; do not imply precision from
  a small pilot.
- Record model/provider version, Agent Definition hash, candidate prompt hash, fixture revision, and harness revision.

Report both average trial behavior and strict stability, such as a defect found in all three trials. Do not use a
best-of-three score as the release result.

## Candidate Decision

The pilot does not set universal numeric thresholds before a baseline exists. It answers whether the candidate moves the
Reviewer in the intended direction.

The reconnaissance candidate is acceptable for broader evaluation only when:

- blocking-finding precision and clean approval do not materially regress;
- recall improves on assumption, boundary, integration, concurrency, or error-path defects;
- severe misses do not increase;
- verification-round defect-state accuracy does not regress;
- additional latency and token cost are proportionate to the improvement;
- no new protocol-completion failure appears.

Keep each release measure separate. A weighted total or F-score may be shown as a convenience, but it cannot waive a
precision collapse, a severe miss, or a clean-approval regression.

## Pilot Size

The reviewable pilot catalog contains:

- 12 discovery families, each with a defective and clean twin: 24 scenarios;
- 6 multi-defect discovery scenarios;
- 6 repair-state verification scenarios.

That produces 36 scenarios. Two prompt configurations with three trials each require 216 Reviewer rounds. Start with a
one-trial smoke pass before spending the full model budget.

## External Methodology References

- [SWR-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01494) uses Pull Request-level full-project context and evaluates coverage of
  independently verified review issues instead of prose overlap.
- [CR-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.11078) emphasizes the trade-off between issue resolution and spurious findings,
  which is why this scorecard keeps recall and precision separate.
- [MCR-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.27442) evaluates defect state across multi-round review, which informs the
  separate repair-state track.

External corpora can later become adapters. The WLD-native pilot remains necessary because public benchmarks do not
cover Approved Plan adherence, Review Issue Ledger identity, RunWield lifecycle authority, or focused repair behavior.
