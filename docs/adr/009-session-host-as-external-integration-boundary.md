# ADR-009: Session Host as the External Integration Boundary

## Status

Accepted

## Context

RunWield's current interactive runtime stores root Agent Session, active Agent, pending swaps, UI state, and workflow
execution state in process-global single-session state. That is sufficient for the TUI, but it blocks ACP, Telegram,
Workspace, and other external clients that need multiple independent sessions in one process.

## Decision

Introduce a multi-session **Session Host** as the runtime owner for RunWield Agent Sessions, and move session-scoped
state out of `session-state.js` globals into per-HostedSession state rather than adding compatibility shims. The
existing TUI becomes a client of one HostedSession, while ACP and future transports can create, load, prompt, cancel,
and observe multiple HostedSessions through the same boundary.

## Consequences

This is a deliberate architecture-breaking refactor and should happen on an isolation branch with TDD coverage proving
both TUI behavior preservation and two-session isolation. The payoff is a single runtime boundary for TUI, ACP,
Workspace UI, and messaging transports instead of separate TUI-only and external-client execution paths.
