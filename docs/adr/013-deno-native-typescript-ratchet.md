# 013 - Deno-Native TypeScript Ratchet

## Context

ADR-000 selected vanilla JavaScript with JSDoc to avoid a TypeScript transpilation or bundling pipeline. That decision
kept early RunWield iteration fast, but the codebase now has enough type-heavy runtime, workflow, and UI boundaries that
native TypeScript syntax is useful for new code.

RunWield still needs Deno-native execution: source files should run directly, imports should use real file extensions,
and CI should type-check without introducing `tsc`, generated runtime `dist/` output, or a CLI bundling step.

## Decision

RunWield will use a mixed JavaScript/TypeScript codebase with a ratchet policy:

- Existing JavaScript and JSX production files remain valid and continue to use JSDoc for typing.
- New production source under `src/` must be TypeScript (`.ts` or `.tsx`) unless it is intentionally added to the
  language-policy baseline.
- TypeScript is executed and checked directly by Deno. We will not introduce a `tsc` emit pipeline, runtime `dist/`
  directory, or CLI bundler for normal source execution.
- Imports must use real source file extensions, including `.ts` when importing TypeScript modules from JavaScript.
- Workspace TypeScript and TSX remain checked through Astro/Vite via `deno task workspace:check`; non-Workspace
  TypeScript and TSX are checked directly by the main Deno check task.
- `scripts/language-policy-baseline.json` records current production JavaScript/JSX under `src/`. Migrations remove
  paths from that baseline in the same change that converts them to TypeScript.

## Consequences

### Positive

- New production code can use native TypeScript where it improves clarity and type safety.
- Existing JavaScript remains stable; the ratchet avoids a risky big-bang migration.
- CI prevents accidental growth of production JavaScript while still allowing deliberate exceptions.
- Runtime behavior remains Deno-native and source-directed.

### Negative

- The repository remains mixed-language for some time.
- Import extensions must be maintained carefully during migrations.
- Baseline updates are required whenever production JavaScript is intentionally migrated, deleted, or added as an
  exception.
