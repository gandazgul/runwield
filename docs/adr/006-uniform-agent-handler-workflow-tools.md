# ADR-006: Active Agents Use One Workflow-Aware Handler

## Context

RunWield previously treated Router as both an Agent and a workflow entrypoint. The runtime had a Router-specific handler
that consumed `triage_report`, while other Agents used a separate handler that consumed `plan_written` and
`task_completed`.

That split made Agent activation shallow and fragile. Boot, `/agent`, `return_to_router`, `load-plan`, and workflow
restores all had to know which handler to install. If any path activated Router with the normal Agent handler, Router
could call `triage_report` successfully but nothing would dispatch the workflow afterward.

## Decision

All active Agents use one Agent Handler.

The Agent Handler does not infer workflow transitions from returned messages or transcript text. Accepted workflow
Custom Tools publish typed Workflow Tool Events. The handler or validation owner claims the event once and settles it
after the durable lifecycle or validation checkpoint is safe to retry.

- `triage_report` publishes routing data and starts post-triage workflow dispatch.
- `plan_written` publishes the Plan review outcome and starts execution, starts decomposition, or keeps planning active.
- `task_completed` publishes the accepted completion and continues active execution or Workflow Validation when
  execution context exists.
- `review_diff`, `review_complete`, and `qa_checklist_generated` publish isolated validation evidence for the current
  owner and generation.

Router is the default Agent for fresh Triage, but Router has no special runtime handler. If another Agent is granted
`triage_report`, the same post-triage workflow dispatch runs from that accepted event.

Agent switching is uniform. Boot, `/agent`, `return_to_router`, Plan recovery, validation restore, and workflow steps
activate an Agent by installing the same Agent Handler for the chosen Agent Name.

Workflow-only Agent Definitions such as Reviewer, Slicer, and Init are still Agents. They may be hidden from `/agent`
selection and may be run as one-shot workflow Agent Sessions, but they are not special runtime modes. When a
workflow-only Agent remains active for follow-up turns, such as Slicer during Epic decomposition, RunWield uses the same
Agent Handler with explicit session data for that Agent Definition and its workflow-scoped Custom Tools.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Locality**: workflow outcome interpretation is concentrated in the Agent Handler and validation owner instead of
  spread across activation call sites.
- **Leverage**: adding a workflow Custom Tool to an Agent preserves the tool's semantics through one event contract.
- **Simpler session model**: active Agent identity is data; there is no hidden "Router mode."
- **Safer authority**: forged or stale transcript-shaped tool results cannot advance workflow state.

### Negative

- The Agent Handler now knows about all first-class workflow Custom Tool outcomes. That is intentional: the handler is
  the seam between Agent Sessions and workflow orchestration.
- Callers that previously injected handler factories for tests must use `createAgentHandler`; older alternate handler
  names are intentionally removed.
