# Conversational Pair checkpoints and ACP interview chat fallback

## Summary

Completed this Epic as done enough after both child Plans were validated. Pair checkpoints, including final assent, now
continue through ordinary conversation in TUI, Workspace, and ACP; typed completion still gates validation. ACP
interviews keep native forms where supported and use chat otherwise, so no local question page or OpenAB patch is needed
for that path.

## Future Planning Notes

ACP interview waits remain process-local and require retry after process loss. The chat fallback applies only to
interviews; command menus and browser reviews retain their existing behavior.
