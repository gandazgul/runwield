# Objective Check waivers added

## Summary

The user attested verification; RunWield Workflow Validation did not establish this result. RunWield now supports
Objective Check Waivers as user-owned judgement for defective Objective-Failing Checks. The work adds structured
broken-check reports from execution agents, durable `objectiveCheckWaivers` Plan metadata, waiver-aware validation
handling, and Work Record evidence for waived checks. The user established verification: Approved by the user after
review; the completed implementation is already present on main and the stale execution worktree was removed.

## Deviations from Plan

The execution report from the stale worktree says that no implementation or verification could run in that session
because only `task_completed` tools were available. Final closure used user verification of the completed implementation
on main.

## Future Planning Notes

Work Records must describe waived Objective-Failing Checks as user-waived evidence, not as met, passed, or
RunWield-verified checks.
