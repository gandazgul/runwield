# Fix published Plan session handoff

## Summary

Verified Plan publication now rebuilds the root Agent Session as Engineer in the primary checkout before clearing the
completed workflow. Explicit working-directory changes rebuild Agent tools, `/load-plan` preserves the verified handoff,
nonterminal recovery keeps its execution context, and parent Epic continuation remains intact. Regression tests, the
seam check, and the full CI task passed; the Core PRD now records the lasting behavior.

## Future Planning Notes

Use the actual verified publication result, not Plan status, for post-publication handoffs. Treat an explicit
working-directory change as a root rebuild even when the Agent does not change.
