# Workspace Session Continuation and Steering

## Result

Workspace starts and continues the same conversation as the TUI. Idle open screens, long history, and retained workflow
context no longer block the next message. The browser discovers active work by Session identity, including a question
waiting in another TUI process. It can answer, steer, queue a follow-up, and stop that work.

Core owns the runtime and steering queue. A temporary private socket exposes the current operation to another surface on
the same machine. Saved history remains in the existing Session files. Opening an interrupted Session uses Core's
existing transcript recovery. No collaborator ownership or persistent interaction system was added.

The phone layout collapses context details, keeps all composer controls visible, and follows new messages while allowing
older history to be read. Creating a Session publishes its identity during the first response. Reloading reconnects
without duplicating the submitted message or saved history.

## Verification

- `deno task ci`: 357 test files passed, zero failures; type, Workspace, lint, language, seams, and documentation checks
  passed. No new owned injection seams.
- Session integration tests cover a 1,700-event conversation, an already-open TUI reading phone replies, idle workflow
  context, concurrent steering retries, first-response discovery, a separate TUI process's question, and continuation
  after an interrupted writer.
- Eleven focused tests passed in Linux ARM64 with the real Core runtime and scripted model responses. A separate Linux
  smoke test mounted a Git clone at `/workspace/project`, continued Workspace → TUI, and read the result in Workspace.
- Browser checks used the real paired owner HTTP routes with a scripted provider. At phone width, answering a TUI
  question, steering, queue dispatch, Stop, new Session creation, reload, and message display passed. Desktop layout was
  also checked. These checks did not make live model API calls.
- Workspace production build and Compose configuration validation passed. The setup is documented in
  [Workspace in a container](../workspace-container.md).
- Cross-compilation to Linux ARM64 passed. The compiled binary started Workspace in the container with the Git clone
  mounted, redirected an unpaired visitor to pairing, and served the pairing screen with HTTP 200.

## Scope

Workspace and TUI run as the same OS user on one machine or inside one container. Browser disconnection leaves the agent
running. If that process stops, saved history remains available for a follow-up; unfinished waits are not reconstructed.
The [continuation Plan](../plans/workspace-session-continuation-readiness.md) is validated. No commit was made.
