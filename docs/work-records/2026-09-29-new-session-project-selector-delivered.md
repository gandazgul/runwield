# New Session Project Selector Delivered

## Summary

Added a Project selector above the New Session composer that follows the Project route and disappears after creation is
accepted. Drafts and unresolved requests prevent switching; loading, failed reads, and navigation failures have recovery
paths. Project-specific defaults and creation stay bound to the selected Project. Updated Workspace guidance and tests;
the completed change was validated and delivered.

## Future Planning Notes

Keep the route as the source of Project identity and preserve Project-scoped drafts rather than transferring in-progress
input between Projects.
