# Customization

You can change RunWield's Agents, prompt templates, and Skills for one project or for all your projects. For settings,
see the [Settings reference](settings.md); for themes, see [Themes](themes.md).

For the underlying concepts, see [Pi Skills](https://pi.dev/docs/latest/skills) and
[Pi Prompt Templates](https://pi.dev/docs/latest/prompt-templates).

## Where customizations live

RunWield looks in three places, and the first match wins:

1. The project: `.wld/`
2. Your home folder: `~/.wld/`
3. The defaults bundled with RunWield

So a project file overrides your personal one, and your personal one overrides the bundled default.

Run `/reload` after editing anything here so the current Session picks it up.

## Agents

Agents are Markdown files with YAML front matter. Put a file in `.wld/agents/` or `~/.wld/agents/` to change a bundled
Agent's prompt, role, or tools, or to add a new Agent. Use the same name as a bundled Agent to override it.

An override can leave fields out; missing fields come from the next layer down.

To change an Agent's model, use [`agents`](settings.md#agents) in settings instead.

### Limiting shell commands

`bashAllowedCommands` limits which shell commands an Agent may run:

```yaml
bashAllowedCommands:
    - git status
    - git diff
    - ls
```

- Each entry is a command prefix, matched word by word. `git status` allows `git status --short` but not
  `git status-other`.
- The Agent can run one command at a time with ordinary arguments. Pipes, `&&`, redirects, and variable expansion are
  refused.
- `[]` allows no shell commands. `null` removes a list inherited from a lower layer.
- A list replaces the list from a lower layer; the two aren't combined.
- The list only limits the shell. It doesn't give an Agent shell access it doesn't already have.

This is a convenience filter, **not a sandbox**: an allowed command can still have side effects. Claude CLI and
Antigravity CLI use their own shell permissions, which this list doesn't change.

## Prompt templates

A prompt template is a Markdown file that becomes a slash command. `.wld/prompts/commit.md` becomes `/commit`, and
`/commit staged changes` sends the template with "staged changes" as its argument.

RunWield looks for templates in `.wld/prompts/`, `~/.wld/prompts/`, the bundled templates, then installed packages.
Bundled templates are `/commit`, `/release`, and `/code-optimizer`. A template can't replace a built-in command such as
`/help`; RunWield warns you at startup if one tries.

Front matter can set:

```yaml
description: "Explain the current diff"
argument-hint: "<focus>"
agent: operator
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
thinkingLevel: low
```

`agent`, `model`, and `thinkingLevel` switch the Session to those settings and keep them for follow-up messages. Fields
you leave out keep the Session's current settings. In a brand-new Session, templates run with Operator by default, so
`wld /commit` works without front matter.

If a template asks for a different Agent while a workflow, such as a Plan, is still running, RunWield offers to open it
in a new Session instead, so the workflow isn't interrupted.

## Skills

A Skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` file that teaches an Agent how to do a specific task. Agents see each Skill's name
and description and load the full instructions when they need them. You can also run one directly with `/skill:<name>`;
it runs in the current Agent's turn.

RunWield looks for Skills here, and the first match wins:

1. `.wld/skills/` in the project
2. `.agents/skills/` in the project
3. `~/.wld/skills/`
4. `~/.agents/skills/`
5. The bundled Skills

Skills in an `.agents/skills/` folder can't use a bundled Skill's name. To replace a bundled Skill, put yours in a
`.wld/skills/` folder. To ignore both `.agents/skills/` folders, set
[`enableExternalSkills`](settings.md#runwield-custom-keys) to `false`.

`npx skills add <source>`.
