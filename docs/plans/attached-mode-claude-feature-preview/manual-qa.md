# Manual QA for attached-mode-claude-feature-preview

This checklist is advisory. It does not change RunWield verification status.

## Activate and resume an Attached Workflow

Manual verification steps for attached-mode-claude-feature-preview/01-activate-and-resume-an-attached-workflow

- [ ] In a project, activate an Attached Workflow and confirm the JSON reports a new workflow, revision 1, and a pending
      Triage action.
- [ ] Confirm activation creates no repository files and does not change `.gitignore`.
- [ ] In a fresh process, submit a valid PLANNED_CHANGE Triage outcome and confirm status reports `awaiting_planning` at
      revision 2 with the next action to plan.
- [ ] Repeat the same submission and confirm it returns the saved result without changing the record.
- [ ] Submit an unsupported Routing Intent and confirm the workflow closes with an unsupported-in-preview result.

## Plan one FEATURE request inside Claude Code

Manual verification steps for attached-mode-claude-feature-preview/02-plan-one-feature-request-inside-claude-code

- [ ] Load the plugin with `claude --plugin-dir src/attached/claude/plugin` and run
      `/runwield:request add a dark-mode toggle`; confirm Claude shows the setup preview before it writes the Plan.
- [ ] Confirm Claude writes the Plan under `docs/plans/` and submits it; run `wld` and confirm the Plan appears in
      `draft` with a Plan ID.
- [ ] Ask Claude an unrelated question after submission; confirm it answers normally.

## Review and approve Plans through durable Plannotator decisions

Manual verification steps for
attached-mode-claude-feature-preview/03-review-and-approve-plans-through-durable-plannotator-decisions

- [ ] In Claude Code, submit a plan and confirm the Plannotator review opens in the browser.
- [ ] Submit feedback, confirm Claude receives it, revises the plan, and opens the next review round in the same browser
      page.
- [ ] Approve a reviewed plan and confirm its status becomes `ready_for_work`.
- [ ] With a review pending, stop the MCP server; start a fresh Claude conversation and run `/runwield:plan-review`.
      Confirm the review reopens and the old browser endpoint is no longer active.

## Implement approved Plans in RunWield worktrees

Manual verification steps for attached-mode-claude-feature-preview/04-implement-approved-plans-in-runwield-worktrees

- [ ] Record the Claude Code version. Load the plugin, request a small FEATURE, and approve its Plan. Confirm Claude
      calls `start_execution` immediately without asking for another execution confirmation.
- [ ] Confirm Claude reports the RunWield worktree path, branch, and managed `.gitignore` block. Compare the invoking
      branch, HEAD, dirty files, and untracked files before and after; only the disclosed ignore block may change.
- [ ] Confirm a fresh host subagent receives the execution directory, Plan path/name, and engineer or frontend-engineer
      instructions. Confirm it uses that directory and does not request host worktree isolation or call RunWield.
- [ ] Confirm the worker returns a bullet report, then the coordinating conversation submits `task_completed.message`.
      Inspect Core Plan status (`implemented`), registry (`completed`), baseline, and Git implementation checkpoint.
      Confirm the result does not claim validation, Verified, publication, or workflow closure.
- [ ] Stop the worker or MCP process during implementation. In a fresh conversation, run `/runwield:implement` and
      confirm the same worktree, action, Plan, and current role instructions return; no second attempt is created.
- [ ] In a non-Git project, confirm Claude asks the reduced-recovery disclosure in plain text. Decline and confirm it
      stops without automatically asking again or restarting. In a separate request, proceed and confirm Core remembers
      consent and the worker edits only the disclosed current directory.
- [ ] Submit stale revision/action evidence or change the execution Plan body before completion. Confirm Core rejects
      the result without a completion checkpoint. Confirm a transport retry of an accepted operation repeats no effects.
- [ ] Confirm Claude owns every model call and RunWield starts no Claude/Pi model process. Validation and publication
      remain child 05/06 scope, not part of this checklist's implementation result.

### Live acceptance evidence

Claude Code **2.1.293**, macOS, autonomous execution, 2026-10-08:

- Loaded the local plugin and reopened Plannotator in a headed browser. Browser approval caused Claude to call
  `start_execution` without another confirmation, dispatch a fresh host `Agent` worker in the issued directory, and
  submit its report through `task_completed` from the coordinating conversation.
- Core recorded `implemented`, a completed registry entry, and a Git implementation checkpoint. The greeting assertion
  passed. The invoking checkout's status, branch, and HEAD matched the before snapshot.
- Stopped another host while its worker waited in the issued worktree. A fresh `/runwield:implement` restored the same
  worktree and action, dispatched another worker with the returned role instructions, and completed through Core.
- The first host summary used the worker's earlier uncommitted state. Command instructions now require Core's checkpoint
  state and the `.gitignore` exception; the restored host reported both correctly.
- Evidence: `/tmp/runwield-attached-live.u1sXM9/` contains host JSONL, review screenshots, before snapshots, and durable
  record snapshots. Non-Git proceed/decline and stale completion guards have automated real-environment coverage.
