# Plan Branch Delivery Setting

## Context

Today every standalone Planned Change is published by an automatic merge into its `targetBranch` (or the current
checkout branch when unset) right after validation and the code review gate. The user wants that automatic merge to be
optional, and off by default: RunWield should stop at a per-Plan branch, the way Epics already stop at their Epic
branch, and the user merges onward themselves.

This is the simple version the user asked for instead of advancing the
[Forge Change Request Delivery](forge-change-request-delivery.md) Epic. That Epic stays as-is and is not modified by
this Plan.

Owning capability: `docs/prd/runwield-core-prd.md#execution-validation-and-recovery`. The requirement "Verified means
the reviewed implementation reached its target" is unchanged — with the setting off, the Plan's target becomes the Plan
Branch, so Verified still means exactly "reached its target".

Decisions made with the user during planning:

- The setting applies only to standalone Planned Changes (classification `PLANNED_CHANGE`, no `parentPlan`). Epic and
  Sequence children keep merging into their Epic branch; PROJECT Epics are not executed directly; QUICK_FIX is out of
  scope.
- Default is off (no automatic merge into `targetBranch`).
- "main" means the repository's default branch (origin's `HEAD`, falling back to `main`), not a literal `main` ref, so
  `master`-default repositories keep working.
- When the setting is on, behavior is exactly today's: worktree from `targetBranch` or, when unset, the current checkout
  branch, and merge back into it.
- Push behavior follows the existing publication machinery: when the project has an upstream remote, the Plan Branch is
  pushed to it (so the user can open a pull request); local-only projects merge into the local Plan Branch.

## Objective

A new setting, `plans.autoMergeIntoTargetBranch` (default `false`), controls how a standalone Planned Change delivers:

```text
setting off (default):
  source = targetBranch, or the repo default branch when unset
  ensure branch plan/<plan-name> exists, created from source
  write targetBranch: plan/<plan-name> into the Plan      (Epic-style adoption)
  worktree based on plan/<plan-name>
  merge back into plan/<plan-name> -> verified -> Work Record
  user merges plan/<plan-name> into the source branch themselves

setting on:
  today's behavior, unchanged
```

## Approach

Copy the Epic Branch pattern (`src/shared/workflow/epic-branch.ts`) instead of adding a parallel merge path. When the
setting is off, RunWield adopts the Plan Branch as the Plan's `targetBranch` at execution start. Every downstream
consumer — worktree base selection, merge-back, publication attempts, delivery evidence, Verified semantics, Work
Records, cleanup, recovery — already reads `targetBranch`, so none of the merge machinery changes.

```diff
 startActiveExecutionWorkflow (src/shared/workflow/execution-start.ts)
   read targetBranch from Plan front matter
+  if standalone PLANNED_CHANGE && setting off && targetBranch is not already plan/-prefixed
+    ensure plan/<plan-name> exists, created from targetBranch || repo default
+    rewrite Plan targetBranch to plan/<plan-name>   (inside the locked preparation transition)
   prepareTarget(targetBranch) -> worktree base
   ... execution, validation, review ...
   publication merges into targetBranch               (unchanged; now the Plan Branch)
```

The adoption rule, in full:

```text
targetBranch unset            -> adopt plan/<plan-name>, created from the repo default branch
targetBranch set, not plan/*  -> adopt plan/<plan-name>, created from targetBranch
targetBranch already plan/*   -> use as-is (idempotent resume; also respects a user-authored plan/ branch)
```

The main option set aside: keep `targetBranch` pointing at the ultimate target and track the Plan Branch in a separate
field. That would break "Verified means reached its target" (Verified would be claimed while the work is not in the
target branch) and would move the merge-target decision into `validation-publication.ts`, recovery, and evidence
builders — one decision encoded in several modules. The Epic-style rewrite keeps one decision in one place.

> [!NOTE]
> **The Plan stops recording the ultimate target**
>
> After adoption the Plan's `targetBranch` is `plan/<plan-name>`, and the source branch (usually the repo default) is no
> longer in front matter — the same trade-off Epic Branches already make. The delivery evidence still records
> `targetHeadBeforeMerge`, and the branch's merge-base with the default branch shows where it started.

## Expected Change Surface

- `src/shared/settings.js` — new `shouldAutoMergePlansIntoTargetBranch(projectRoot)` reading nested
  `plans.autoMergeIntoTargetBranch` through `getMergedCustomSetting` (project overrides global), default `false`;
  follows the `shouldAutoGenerateWorkRecordsOnPlanCompletion` pattern.
- `src/cmd/settings/policies.ts` — new boolean policy "Auto-merge into target branch" (Off default / On) in the
  `wld settings` policy list, project or global scope.
- `src/shared/workflow/plan-branch.ts` (new) — Plan Branch naming, creation, and the adoption gate; mirrors
  `epic-branch.ts` but much smaller (no child seeding, no family logic).
- `src/shared/workflow/execution-start.ts` — adoption hook inside the execution preparation transition, before worktree
  creation.
- `src/shared/worktree.js` — likely small export or helper so `plan-branch.ts` can create a branch from a specific
  source ref (today `prepareTargetBranchRef` only creates from the repo default).
- `docs/domain-language.md` — new **Plan Branch** entry mirroring **Epic Branch**.
- `docs/plan-lifecycle.md` — `targetBranch` paragraph mentions Plan Branch adoption.
- `docs/prd/runwield-core-prd.md` — owning capability gains the setting requirement and scenarios.
- `docs/prd/forge-change-request-delivery-prd.md` — its "Direct Delivery remains the default … merges into the local
  target branch" statements are adjusted to the new default; Epic scope itself is untouched.
- Existing workflow/publication tests that run standalone Plans without the setting — expectations move to the Plan
  Branch flow, or they enable the setting to keep covering the on-path.

This list is guidance, not an allowlist: verify the real footprint during implementation and change whatever the
Implementation Steps need. Stop and report only when discovery changes approved intent.

## Reuse Opportunities

- `src/shared/workflow/epic-branch.ts` — the adoption pattern: create the branch before recording it, write
  `targetBranch` through `updatePlanFrontMatter` with `expectedRevision`, use an existing branch as-is.
- `src/shared/worktree.js` — `prepareTargetBranchRef` / `createLocalBranchFromDefault` (repo-default resolution,
  remote-first), `assertValidTargetBranchName`, `remoteBranchExists`, `slugify`.
- `src/shared/settings.js` — `getMergedCustomSetting` nested-key pattern (`workRecords.autoGenerateOnPlanCompletion`).
- `src/shared/git-test-fixture.ts` (`defineGitFixture`) — real repositories for the new tests; no new seams
  (`deno task seams:check` must stay clean).

## Implementation Steps

- `src/shared/settings.js` exports `shouldAutoMergePlansIntoTargetBranch(projectRoot): boolean`; it returns `true` only
  when the merged `plans` object's `autoMergeIntoTargetBranch` is literally `true`, and `false` otherwise (unset,
  non-boolean, or non-object `plans`). Unit tests cover default-false, project-over-global, and invalid values.
- `src/cmd/settings/policies.ts` lists an "Auto-merge into target branch" policy with Off (default) and On choices,
  saved as `plans.autoMergeIntoTargetBranch` in the chosen scope; `src/cmd/settings/index.test.ts` covers persisting
  both values and the scope prompt.
- `src/shared/workflow/plan-branch.ts` exists and exports `PLAN_BRANCH_PREFIX` (`"plan/"`),
  `defaultPlanBranchName(planName)` (slug of the full Plan name, same slug rules as the worktree branch), and
  `ensurePlanBranch({ projectRoot, planName, sourceBranch })` which: uses an existing `plan/<plan-name>` branch as-is;
  otherwise creates it from `sourceBranch` (remote ref first, then local ref) or, when `sourceBranch` is unset, from the
  repo default branch; and returns `{ branch, created }`. It never checks out, resets, or writes any working tree.
- `src/shared/workflow/plan-branch.ts` exports the adoption gate: adoption applies exactly when the Plan's
  classification is `PLANNED_CHANGE` (or legacy `FEATURE`), it has no `parentPlan`, the setting is off, and its
  `targetBranch` is unset or does not start with `plan/`. Tests prove Epic children, PROJECT Plans, and `plan/`-prefixed
  targets are excluded.
- In `startActiveExecutionWorkflow` (`src/shared/workflow/execution-start.ts`), when the adoption gate passes, the
  preparation transition's `prepare` step: (1) calls `ensurePlanBranch` with the Plan's `targetBranch` as source (or
  unset for repo default), (2) rewrites the canonical Plan's `targetBranch` to the Plan Branch via
  `updatePlanFrontMatter` under the plan lock with the locked revision, and (3) bases the new worktree on the Plan
  Branch, so `createWorktreeGitArtifacts` records it as `baseBranch`. The branch exists before the front-matter write. A
  resumed or repaired Plan whose `targetBranch` is already the Plan Branch skips adoption and reuses it.
- No change to `src/shared/workflow/validation-publication.ts`, `src/shared/isolated-publication.ts`, or
  `src/shared/worktree.js` merge logic is required for the off-path; an integration test proves the merge lands on
  `plan/<plan-name>`, the source branch's head is unchanged, the Plan becomes `verified` with delivery evidence
  recording the Plan Branch, and the Work Record generates.
- The on-path is provably unchanged: with `plans.autoMergeIntoTargetBranch: true`, a standalone Plan without
  `targetBranch` bases its worktree on the current checkout branch and merges back into it, exactly as today.
- `docs/domain-language.md` defines **Plan Branch** (branch a standalone Planned Change delivers to when auto-merge is
  off, recorded as the Plan's `targetBranch`, default `plan/<plan-name>`, created from the Plan's target or the repo
  default branch; RunWield never merges it onward; the user merges it or opens a pull request; _Avoid_: feature branch,
  Epic Branch) and the entry contains no unimplemented claims.
- `docs/plan-lifecycle.md`'s `targetBranch` paragraph states that RunWield may adopt a Plan Branch as the delivery
  target at execution start when the setting is off.
- `docs/prd/runwield-core-prd.md#execution-validation-and-recovery` gains a named requirement for the
  `plans.autoMergeIntoTargetBranch` setting (default off; Plan Branch delivery; on-path preserves today's behavior) with
  acceptance scenarios for both paths, and existing scenarios that assumed automatic merge-into-target are updated
  rather than contradicted.
- `docs/prd/forge-change-request-delivery-prd.md` statements that Direct Delivery is the default that "merges it into
  the local target branch" are updated to name the setting and the Plan Branch stop point; no Epic scope, objectives, or
  invariants change.
- Every existing test that executes a standalone Planned Change end-to-end without the setting either asserts the new
  Plan Branch flow or explicitly enables the setting to keep asserting the on-path; no test is deleted for compile
  reasons without that split being recorded in the change.

## Approval Confirmation

No `supersedes` Work Record IDs are proposed; this is new behavior, not a replacement of a delivered record.

## Verification Plan

- Automated: `deno task test` (full suite; RunWield also runs `deno task ci` after implementation). Focused new
  coverage:
  - `src/shared/workflow/plan-branch.test.ts` (real Git fixture): default naming; creation from an explicit source
    branch; creation from the repo default when unset; existing-branch reuse without recreation; adoption-gate
    exclusions (Epic child with `parentPlan`, PROJECT, `plan/`-prefixed target).
  - Settings unit tests: default false, project-over-global precedence, non-boolean values ignored.
  - An execution-start + publication integration test (real Git fixture, setting off): branch `plan/<plan-name>` exists
    and is based on the repo default; the worktree `baseBranch` is the Plan Branch; the Plan's front matter records
    `targetBranch: plan/<plan-name>`; after validation the merge commit is on the Plan Branch; the source branch head is
    unchanged; the Plan is `verified`. This test fails if the setting is added but not wired into execution start, or if
    publication still merges into the source branch.
  - An on-path integration test (setting true, no `targetBranch`): worktree based on the current checkout branch and
    merged back into it — today's behavior, protected.
- Manual: in a scratch repository, run `wld settings`, toggle "Auto-merge into target branch" off (default) and on; load
  a small standalone Plan end-to-end with the setting off and confirm `git branch` shows `plan/<plan-name>`, the default
  branch is untouched, and the Plan shows Verified; then repeat with the setting on and confirm the merge lands on the
  target/current branch.
- Behavior that must survive: Epic and Sequence children still deliver to their Epic branch; the on-path is
  byte-for-byte today's flow; publication evidence, recovery, Work Record generation, and worktree cleanup semantics are
  unchanged (their target is now the Plan Branch). Behavior that intentionally stops existing: standalone Planned
  Changes no longer merge into `targetBranch`/current checkout automatically unless the setting is on.
- Confirm `docs/domain-language.md`, `docs/plan-lifecycle.md`, and both PRDs describe the delivered behavior with no
  unimplemented proposals promoted as current.

## Edge Cases & Considerations

- **Default flip changes every existing standalone-Plan flow** — the off-path is the new default, so existing tests and
  golden scenarios that assert merge-into-target must be updated or moved to the on-path; the step list makes that split
  explicit so coverage is not silently lost.
- **Two Plans slug to the same branch name** (e.g. `fix-a` and `fix/a`) — the second Plan adopts the first's existing
  branch. Rare for standalone Plans (nested names are usually Epic children, which are excluded); accepted, same
  trade-off as Epic Branch naming.
- **Repo has no `main`** — repo-default resolution (origin `HEAD`, then `main`) already handles `master`-default
  repositories; a repository with neither fails with the existing "does not exist" error before any Plan state changes.
- **User-authored `plan/` target** — used as-is, never re-based or re-adopted; mirrors how a named Epic branch is
  respected.
- **Remote projects** — the existing remote publication path pushes the Plan Branch to the upstream (creating it there
  when absent), which is what makes a pull request possible; local-only projects merge locally. No new push logic is
  added.
- **Setting changed between attempts** — a Plan that already adopted a Plan Branch keeps it (the `plan/` prefix rule
  makes adoption idempotent); toggling the setting does not retarget an in-flight or resumed attempt, matching the
  existing rule that changing checkout metadata does not retarget an active attempt.
- **Non-Git projects** — the in-place execution path returns before target resolution; unaffected.
