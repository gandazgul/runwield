## Core Measurement History and Durable Recording

Manual verification steps for
reliable-usage-dashboard-and-langfuse-export/01-core-measurement-history-and-default-on-recording

- [ ] With recording disabled, perform workflow activity and confirm that no new metrics are recorded; enable recording
      and confirm that new activity is recorded.
- [ ] Disable recording, perform workflow activity, then re-enable it. Confirm that activity from the disabled interval
      is not recorded or replayed, and that the journal shows the observed collection boundary.
- [ ] Open existing v1 metrics before and after recording is enabled. Confirm that the v1 records remain intact and
      readable.
- [ ] Cause a journal write failure or lock timeout. Confirm that workflow work completes and the result reports that
      the measurement was not saved.

## Real Model Usage Across Backends and Auxiliary Calls

Manual verification steps for
reliable-usage-dashboard-and-langfuse-export/02-real-model-usage-across-backends-and-auxiliary-calls

- [ ] Run a session with missing usage fields; confirm the runtime event, replay totals, and footer show unavailable
      values, not zero.
- [ ] Open a session with compaction usage; confirm replay shows it as a separate component and excludes it from
      assistant totals.
- [ ] Run a vision fallback call with usage; confirm exactly one usage observation contains the reported values. Repeat
      with missing usage and confirm it is marked unavailable.
- [ ] Run Guided Review with measured and missing usage; confirm one aggregated usage observation per settled external
      job and that the outcome event still appears.
- [ ] Review Claude and agy session usage; confirm supplied zero remains zero, absent values remain unavailable, and agy
      cost is never shown as zero.

## Workflow Outcome Observations

Manual verification steps for reliable-usage-dashboard-and-langfuse-export/03-workflow-outcome-observations

- [ ] Complete a workflow with a failed validation, a repair round, and confirmed publication. Confirm the dashboard
      shows separate validation-attempt, repair-round, and publication counts.
- [ ] Repeat publication cleanup for the same attempt. Confirm the publication count does not increase.
- [ ] Disable metric recording or make the metrics journal unavailable, then confirm publication still completes.
- [ ] View observations for a workflow with no committed Plan association. Confirm they have no Plan attribution.

## Core Usage Reporting, Retention, and Clear

Manual verification steps for reliable-usage-dashboard-and-langfuse-export/04-core-usage-reporting-retention-and-clear

- [ ] Review a report for a known period and confirm token, cost, and latency totals match its recorded observations.
- [ ] Confirm the report distinguishes a covered zero-activity day from disabled or legacy-only gaps, and assigns
      activity to the correct local day across a daylight-saving change.
- [ ] Clear one Project's measurement history; confirm another Project's history and the selected Project's Sessions,
      Plans, worktrees, and configuration remain intact.
- [ ] Record a new observation after clearing and confirm it appears in the report, while cleared history does not
      return after restart.
