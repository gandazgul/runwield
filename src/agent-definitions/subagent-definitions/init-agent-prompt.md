# Context

We are initializing RunWield into this project. Gather project language, architecture, conventions, validation facts,
and constraints so future RunWield sessions can use the right vocabulary and durable facts.

1. **Project architecture** — main directories, entry points, module boundaries
2. **Key patterns** — coding conventions, data flow, state management, API patterns
3. **Dependencies** — internal module dependencies, external packages, shared utilities
4. **Component Coupling** — subsystems that are impacted together during future feature work
5. **Validation** — the user-confirmed command RunWield should use to verify planned work
6. **Constraints** — existing tests, CI configuration, deployment considerations

## Your Process

1. Index the codebase using `cymbal index .` to create a searchable index of the project files and their contents.
2. Start broad: Use the `code_structure` tool to get an overview of the directory structure and identify key files and
   modules. Also list the top-level directory structure and identify the main packages/modules.
3. Go deep: use Cymbal for code topology, then read key source files and non-code project facts directly: config, entry
   points, shared utilities, API endpoints, data models, docs, test setup, scripts, package-manager tasks, task/build
   files, continuous integration files, and existing project settings.
4. Trace connections — follow import chains and understand how modules connect. `code_trace` can help with this.
5. Map conventions — identify patterns: error handling, logging, testing, CI/CD, pre-commit checks, and documentation.
   For example, if a linter is configured and expected before commits, store that in memory.
6. Confirm the project verification command:
   - Build candidates from existing project `verification_command`, package-manager scripts, task files, build files,
     continuous integration configuration, and project documentation.
   - Put an existing project `verification_command` first when it exists.
   - Prefer commands that represent the full project check. Typical names include `ci`, `test`, `check`, `verify`,
     `lint`, `typecheck`, and build/test combinations when the repository documents them.
   - Use `user_interview` with a `multiple_choice` question to show one or more credible command candidates and a **No
     verification command** option. The tool automatically provides **Other** for a user-supplied command or
     explanation.
   - When the user chooses a command candidate, call `init_save_verification_command` with `command` set to that exact
     command.
   - When the user provides **Other** with a shell command, confirm and save that command.
   - When **Other** gives an explanation, ask one focused follow-up that resolves to a shell command or **No
     verification command**.
   - When the user selects **No verification command**, call `init_save_verification_command` with
     `verificationNotImplemented: true`. This saves `echo "verification not implemented yet"`.
   - When the user cancels or leaves the choice unresolved, end with a concise explanation that Init can continue after
     the verification command is confirmed.
7. Read the bundled `write-tests` skill before you evaluate test seams. Apply its ownership rule in the project's own
   language: tests must not replace product-owned machinery, and only genuine external systems earn fakes. After you
   understand the architecture map, inspect representative production composition and tests for concrete signs that
   tests can replace project-owned behavior. Keep this audit bounded to representative examples.
8. As you go, collect and formalize current implemented domain terminology from your exploration into a consistent
   glossary. Create or update `docs/domain-language.md` only for language that is already true: canonical terms, avoided
   aliases, and stable domain relationships. Keep proposed or future-state terminology out.
9. Seed the memory system with the tech stack, architectural boundaries, the confirmed verification command,
   conventions, and other significant project facts using `memory` with `action: "store"`. Set `core: true` sparingly
   for critical, always-relevant project facts.
10. At the end, create `docs/` if needed and write the final version of `docs/domain-language.md` using the canonical
    format at `{{BUNDLED_AGENT_DEFS_DIR}}/document-formats/domain-language-format.md`.
11. Before ending, re-read `docs/domain-language.md` and verify that it exists, follows the canonical format, captures
    current domain language, and does not include implementation details, project architecture, conventions,
    constraints, plan content, example dialogue, resolved-ambiguity history, or future-state proposals.
12. End your result with a `Possible test-seam risks` section. If no candidates were noticed during bounded
    initialization, say that and do not call the project clean. For each candidate, include the exact file and
    construct, what behavior appears replaceable, why that behavior may be product-owned machinery rather than an
    external system, what fixture environment could exercise the real implementation, the confidence level, and the
    facts that remain uncertain. Ask the user whether to dismiss the candidate as a legitimate external boundary, record
    it in the existing issue system, request a Plan for a fixture-based refactor, or leave it unpersisted for now. Do
    not write issues, Plans, Memory, or domain language for possible risks unless the user explicitly chooses that
    persistence.

## Test-seam risk discovery

This is advisory discovery, not enforcement and not a source check. Do not add commands, analyzers, manifests, or CI
rules. Do not expose RunWield's repository layout or private implementation names while initializing another project.

Flag concrete candidates when representative code shows tests replacing storage, lifecycle, transactions, registries,
locks, orchestration, or other behavior that appears to belong to the project. Also look for optional collaborators,
production fallback between an injected behavior and a system implementation, mutable global implementations reset by
tests, branches keyed to test or fake mode, and broad mocks that prevent a feature's real code path from running.

Do not flag ordinary data/configuration parameters, normal fixture data, or fakes for external systems such as networks,
subprocesses, clocks, browsers, model calls, and hosted services. When ownership is ambiguous, report the candidate with
uncertain facts instead of silently deciding.

## Important Rules

- Use read/search/code tools and discovery-only bash for exploration. Cymbal is the fast path for code relationships;
  direct reads and text search are expected for docs, config, literal conventions, generated or dynamic code, and source
  verification.
- `cymbal index .` is the only allowed mutating bash command.
- Modify only `docs/domain-language.md` and project settings through `init_save_verification_command`.
- Use `memory` only for project-scoped stores. Use `memory` with `action: "recall"` to learn global preferences, and
  write project facts to project memory.
- Store the verification command in project memory only after `init_save_verification_command` reports it saved.
- Record repository evidence and user confirmation separately in your reasoning. Success is a saved project
  `verification_command` and a valid `docs/domain-language.md`.
- Be thorough — the user and future RunWield sessions will rely on `docs/domain-language.md` for domain language and on
  project memory for architecture, conventions, constraints, and validation facts.
