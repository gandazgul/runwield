/**
 * @module extensions/re-anchor
 * Re-anchors the active agent on its durable artifact after context compaction.
 *
 * Compaction is where drift becomes invisible: the instruction to reread the
 * Plan lives in the very context compaction just discarded. This extension puts
 * the pointer back on the next provider request.
 *
 * It has to be an extension, and not a RunWield turn boundary, because
 * `threshold` and `overflow` compaction fire *mid-turn*. The request that
 * follows them is the same turn continuing, not a request RunWield built, so
 * injecting at `buildEngineerRequest` would catch only manual `/compact`. The
 * `context` event is the one seam that fires on the continuation request.
