const PLAN_STEPS = `## Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Renaming a Plan appends its old name to \`previousNames\` and leaves the body unchanged.
- [ ] Step 2: \`resolvePlan("old-name")\` returns the renamed Plan when no file matches the old name.
- [ ] Step 3: A Workspace request for an old name redirects to the current Plan URL.
- [ ] Step 4: Two Plans that list the same previous name resolve to neither, and the conflict is reported.
- [ ] Step 5: Plan lists and boards show only current names.
- [ ] Step 6: Plan Review shows the current name after following an old link.
- [ ] Step 7: \`plan-resolver.test.ts\` covers resolution, redirects, and the conflict case.
- [ ] Step 8: The Workspace PRD describes the redirect behavior.

# Keep Saved Plan Links Working After Rename

## Context

Renaming a Plan changes its file name. Links saved in Sessions, Work Records, and chat history then stop opening it, and
users search for the Plan by hand.

> [!NOTE]
> **The Plan file stays the source of truth**
>
> Do not add a database or a second copy of the Plan. Links resolve from files in \`docs/plans/\`.

## Objective

Old Plan links open the renamed Plan, and new links use the new name.

- A renamed Plan records its previous names in front matter.
- Opening an old name redirects to the current Plan.
- Lists and boards show only the current name.

## Approach

Record each previous name when a rename happens. Check those names only when a link matches no file.

    Alias -->|No| Missing[Show not found]
\`\`\`

> [!TIP]
> **Store previous names in the Plan itself**
>
> The name history moves with the file through branches, merges, and copies. A separate index would drift.

Set aside: a redirect table in the Workspace server. It fails for links opened from the CLI or another checkout.

## Expected Change Surface

- \`src/shared/plans/plan-rename.ts\` — records the previous name when a Plan is renamed.
- \`src/shared/plans/plan-resolver.ts\` — resolves an unknown name through previous names.
- \`src/ui/workspace/pages/projects/[projectId]/plans/[planId].astro\` — redirects old names to the current URL.
- \`src/ui/workspace/react/PlanReviewSurface.tsx\` — shows the current name after a redirect.

## Reuse Opportunities

- \`src/shared/plans/plan-front-matter.ts\` — reads and writes front matter without changing the body.
- \`third_party/plannotator/packages/ui/utils/parser.ts\` — existing Markdown parsing for the preview.

${PLAN_STEPS}
## Verification Plan

- Automated: \`deno run -A scripts/run-tests.js src/shared/plans/plan-resolver.test.ts\`.
- Manual: Rename a Plan, then open its old link from a Session.
- Expected: The old link opens the renamed Plan, and the address bar shows the new name.
- Headed browser: Open an old link at desktop and phone widths and confirm the redirect.

## Edge Cases & Considerations

> [!WARNING]
> **A new Plan can reuse an old name**
>
> A user renames Plan A to B, then creates a new Plan A. The old link opens the new Plan A, because an existing file
> always wins over a previous name.

- Two renamed Plans can list the same previous name. Report the conflict instead of guessing (Step 4).
- Long names such as \`docs/plans/archived/2026-07-13-keep-saved-plan-links-working-after-rename-and-archive.md\` wrap in lists and headers.

Callout syntax inside a code block stays code:

\`\`\`md
> [!WARNING]
> **This is an example, not a callout**
\`\`\`

> An ordinary quote stays a quote: "I lost the link after I renamed the Plan."

/** The same requirements as PLAN_FIXTURE, written as dense prose without callouts, for readability comparison. */
const DENSE_PLAN_FIXTURE = `${PLAN_FRONT_MATTER}
# Keep Saved Plan Links Working After Rename

## Context

This plan addresses the problem that when a Plan is renamed its file name changes, which means that links that were
previously saved in Sessions, Work Records, and chat history no longer open it, and as a result users have to search for
the Plan by hand. It is important to note that the Plan file must remain the source of truth, so we should not introduce
a database or a second copy of the Plan, and links should continue to resolve from the files in \`docs/plans/\`.

## Objective

The objective is essentially to make sure that old Plan links open the renamed Plan while new links use the new name,
which involves having a renamed Plan record its previous names in its front matter, having the opening of an old name
redirect to the current Plan, and making sure that lists and boards show only the current name.

## Approach

The approach is to record each previous name at the time a rename happens and then, when a link does not match any
file, check those previous names; if a previous name matches, we redirect to the current name, and otherwise we show
not found. We store the previous names in the Plan itself because the name history then moves with the file through
branches, merges, and copies, whereas a separate index would drift over time. We considered a redirect table in the
Workspace server but set it aside because it fails for links opened from the CLI or another checkout.

## Expected Change Surface

The change touches \`src/shared/plans/plan-rename.ts\` to record the previous name when a Plan is renamed,
\`src/shared/plans/plan-resolver.ts\` to resolve an unknown name through previous names,
\`src/ui/workspace/pages/projects/[projectId]/plans/[planId].astro\` to redirect old names to the current URL, and
\`src/ui/workspace/react/PlanReviewSurface.tsx\` to show the current name after a redirect.

## Reuse Opportunities

We can reuse \`src/shared/plans/plan-front-matter.ts\`, which reads and writes front matter without changing the body,
and \`third_party/plannotator/packages/ui/utils/parser.ts\` for the existing Markdown parsing in the preview.

${PLAN_STEPS}
## Verification Plan

- Automated: \`deno run -A scripts/run-tests.js src/shared/plans/plan-resolver.test.ts\`.
- Manual: Rename a Plan, then open its old link from a Session.
- Expected: The old link opens the renamed Plan, and the address bar shows the new name.
- Headed browser: Open an old link at desktop and phone widths and confirm the redirect.

## Edge Cases & Considerations

There are various edge cases to consider. If a user renames Plan A to B and then creates a new Plan A, the old link opens
the new Plan A, because an existing file always wins over a previous name. In addition, two renamed Plans can list the
same previous name, in which case we report the conflict instead of guessing (Step 4), and long names such as
\`docs/plans/archived/2026-07-13-keep-saved-plan-links-working-after-rename-and-archive.md\` need to wrap in lists and
headers.

## Overview

## Contents

Use the Contents sidebar to navigate headings. It starts collapsed on phones.

## Progress

- [x] Shared document layout
- [ ] Review the remaining details

## Results
