 *
 * The question it answers is not "does the repair Agent run", which unit tests can show.
 * It is whether RunWield keeps its place: after a dispatched repair the loop has to
 * re-run CI, and only once CI passes may it move on to Semantic Review and delivery.
 * Losing that position is how a change reaches the target branch without ever having a
 * passing build.
 *
 * The failing command is `test -f ci-fix.txt`, so CI fails until the repair creates that
 * file and passes afterwards — the same command throughout, deciding differently because
 * the worktree changed. Nothing in the harness switches it.
