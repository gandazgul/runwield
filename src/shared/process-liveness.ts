/**
 * @module shared/process-liveness
 * Whether the process that wrote a lock file is still running.
 *
 * A lock is a claim by a specific process. When that process is gone the claim is
 * void, and the only honest way to know is to ask the operating system — a
 * timestamp cannot distinguish "crashed a second ago" from "busy and holding it
 * legitimately". Waiting out a timeout instead means a crash makes RunWield
 * unusable for minutes over its own bookkeeping.
 *
 * Shared because the worktree registry lock and the Plan lock both need it and
 * previously disagreed: the registry reclaimed instantly from a dead holder while
 * Plan locks waited on file age.
