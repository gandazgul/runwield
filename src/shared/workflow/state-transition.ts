 * to close its own records.
 *
 * A record is resolvable only on positive evidence: the transition already
 * committed (so only the cleanup delete was lost), it marked no durable effect and
 * the Plan still holds the metadata it read, or a caller-supplied prover confirmed
 * every effect it did mark. Anything else — changed metadata, an effect nothing
 * can vouch for, an irreversible Git move that is not visible in the repository —
 * stays for a human.
 *
 * @param proveEffect supplies repository evidence about journaled effects. Without
 * one, any recorded effect keeps the record open, because this module can see Plan
 * bytes but not Git refs or the worktree registry.
