/**
 * @module shared/workflow/review-ledger
 * Mutable Review Issue Ledger for one semantic review attempt.
 *
 * The ledger is what makes review rounds converge instead of rediscovering the
 * implementation each time. Round one opens it; later rounds resolve items,
 * keep them open, and append newly discovered ones. Identities are stable for
 * the life of the attempt so the Reviewer, the repair agent, and the next round
 * all refer to the same finding.
 *
 * It is plain serializable data because it rides on the active execution
 * workflow record: validation exits whenever it pauses and is re-entered from
 * scratch, so anything held in a loop local is lost on every nudge.
