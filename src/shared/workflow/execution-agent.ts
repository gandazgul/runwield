/**
 * @module shared/workflow/execution-agent
 * The one place that turns a Plan's execution policy owner into the Agent
 * identity the runtime actually activates.
 *
 * A Plan says who owns its execution: `engineer` or `frontend-engineer`. Those
 * two values are durable — they live in Plan Front Matter, in
 * `ActiveExecutionWorkflow.executionAgent`, in worktree records, and in segment
 * handoff markers written by earlier RunWield versions. They never change.
 *
 * The Agent the user talks to during execution is a different thing. An
 * `engineer`-owned Plan runs under the workflow-only **Plan Engineer**, because
 * the selectable Engineer is the elastic QUICK_FIX helper and executes no Plans.
 * Resolving that here, once, is what keeps `plan-engineer` out of every durable
 * record: it is a runtime identity, never a policy value.
