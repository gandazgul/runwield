 * mechanical plan-vs-diff check, so it intentionally receives none of that by default.
 *
 * Every review gets the plan, read-only repository exploration tools (`read`,
 * `grep`, `find`, `ls`), and the `review_diff` tool. The diff is never inlined —
 * there is one delivery path for every round regardless of size. Reviewer has no
 * memory tools so its judgment remains grounded in the supplied evidence.
 *
 * `mode` selects the round contract: `"discovery"` sweeps the whole Plan (rounds
 * one and two), `"verify"` only checks the open ledger and the repair delta
 * (rounds three and above).
