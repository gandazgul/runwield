/**
 * @module shared/git-port
 * The Git boundary: operations RunWield asks Git to perform, and nothing else.
 *
 * Git is a separate program with its own state, so it is a legitimate place to
 * substitute a fake in tests. RunWield's *own* worktree policy is not, even when it
 * has a Git-sounding name — `mergeExecutionWorktree` proves a sealed candidate,
 * enforces candidate and publication policy. Those are RunWield decisions that happen to call Git, and
 * replacing them in a test replaces the behaviour under test.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole point of this file. A dependency bag cannot express
 * it: every entry looks alike, so the machinery ends up as substitutable as the
 * subprocess. Here the boundary is named, so what belongs behind it is a decision
 * someone has to make out loud.
 *
 * Membership test for a method here: it is a thin translation of a Git command, its
 * result is Git's answer rather than RunWield's judgement, and a reader could predict
 * what it runs. Anything that decides *whether* or *how* to publish belongs in the
 * lifecycle, not here.
