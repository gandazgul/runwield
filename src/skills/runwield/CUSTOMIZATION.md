## Layering model

RunWield resolves project `.wld/` overrides before home `~/.wld/` overrides before bundled defaults.

Resolution lists:

- Agents: `.wld/agents/`, `~/.wld/agents/`, bundled `src/agent-definitions/`.
- Prompt templates: `.wld/prompts/`, `~/.wld/prompts/`, bundled `src/prompt-templates/`, installed Pi package
  `pi.prompts`.
- Skills: `.wld/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, `~/.wld/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, bundled `src/skills/`.

## Agent overrides

Agent definition scalar Front Matter values override by precedence. A `tools` key fully replaces the lower-layer tool
list. Agent prompts append by default; set `promptOverride: true` when the higher layer must replace the lower prompt
instead.

## Prompt templates

Put user prompt templates in `~/.wld/prompts/` or project templates in `.wld/prompts/`. The filename becomes the slash
command name. RunWield Core resolves the slash command in TUI, Workspace, and ACP sessions.

Prompt Template Front Matter can set `agent`, `model` (`provider/model`), and `thinkingLevel`. Templates render into
ordinary user messages; settings persist for follow-ups and resume. Omissions inherit the current Session. A new Session
without explicit selections uses Operator and its configured model/thinking level. Changing Agent uses that Agent's
defaults before explicit template overrides. Invalid settings fail before submission. During an unfinished workflow,
changing Agent offers a new Session or cancellation, preserving the original workflow. Model/thinking changes alone keep
the workflow. Core stores the exact expansion for resume and displays the rendered template in chat.

A prompt template cannot override a built-in slash command name. RunWield warns at startup when an installed package
prompt is blocked by a built-in command collision. Use `/reload` after editing prompt files in an active TUI.

Copy bundled templates for examples: `code-optimizer`, `commit`, and `release`. For a user-requested review of a PR or
other changes, invoke `/skill:review` instead.

## Skills

A skill is a directory with `SKILL.md`. A user invokes it with `/skill:<name>`. The Skill expands into the current
Agent's normal turn and keeps that Agent, model, thinking level, workflow tools, and active workflow working directory.
Project external Skills precede home `.wld` Skills only for names that do not conflict with bundled names or aliases.
Use `.wld/skills` for intentional bundled overrides. `enableExternalSkills: false` disables both `.agents` folders.
RunWield ignores Pi-configured, package, and extension Skill catalogs. If the user wants to write a Skill, point them to
the bundled `write-a-skill` skill instead of improvising authoring advice. That skill explains invocation, descriptions,
progressive disclosure, and pruning.

Bundled skills:

- `agent-browser-use`: headed browser feedback loop for frontend and browser behavior.
- `codebase-design`: vocabulary for deep modules, seams, and interface design.
- `diagnose`: reproduce, minimize, hypothesize, instrument, fix, and regression-test bugs.
- `documentation`: write or update Markdown project docs from source evidence.
- `front-end-framework-use`: convention-first frontend JavaScript, HTML, and CSS work.
- `handoff`: prepare durable handoffs between agents or sessions.
- `improve-codebase-architecture`: scan architecture and present deepening opportunities.
- `prompt-writing`: write or tighten LLM prompts and agent instructions.
- `prototype`: build throwaway prototypes for state, business logic, or UI options.
- `research`: capture source-backed research findings as Markdown.
- `review`: review a PR, branch, commit range, or working tree against project standards and the change's spec.
- `resolving-merge-conflicts`: resolve in-progress merge or rebase conflicts.
- `runwield`: answer user-facing questions about RunWield and `wld`.
- `tdd`: use a red-green-refactor loop.
- `wizard`: generate terminal wizards for human-only external setup, credentials, CI secrets, migrations, and cutovers.
- `write-a-skill`: create predictable agent skills.
- `write-tests`: write, update, or repair automated tests.

## Project instructions

`wld init` explores the repository, writes `docs/domain-language.md`, and stores durable project Memory. Project
instructions are read from `RUNWIELD.md` or `AGENTS.md` in the project root. Global instructions are read from
`~/.wld/RUNWIELD.md` or `~/.wld/AGENTS.md`.

## Themes and reload

Themes are selected with `/theme` or `wld theme`. Package themes can be installed with `wld install` and removed with
`wld remove`. Use `/reload` after changing settings, instructions, prompts, skills, models, themes, or memories. Reload
re-scans Prompt Template and Skill layers, rebuilds the active Agent, and replaces autocomplete data only after success.
