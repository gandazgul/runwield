Prompt templates and skills can also appear as slash commands when they do not collide with built-ins.

## TUI input mechanics

- Type `@` to search and attach project file references.
- Use `!command` to run a shell command and send output to the model.
- Use `!!command` to run a shell command without adding output to model context.
- Press Escape to cancel a running turn.
- Type while the Agent is busy to queue the next message.
- Paste images when the model supports images or `visionFallback` is configured.

## Session management

- Use `/new`, `/resume`, `/session`, `/context`, `/compact`, `/export`, and `/share` to manage Sessions in the TUI.
- Use `--continue` to resume the most recent Session from the CLI.
- RunWield stores Sessions under `~/.wld/sessions/`, separate from Pi's `~/.pi/agent/sessions/`.
